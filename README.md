# DECK BOX

This is my 3rd milestone project. Website is created for poeple that play and collect
Magic The Gathering cards. App allows users to hold their cards collection in the app and
manage collection and decks.
Database is NoSQL - MongoDB

## UX

Deck-Box, a place where users can create an account, upload card collection
and build decks, and manage cards. The application allows for easy management 
and building of decks. User does not have to look for cards, after logging in he 
sees his collections, he can add new cards to see what the deck will look like.
